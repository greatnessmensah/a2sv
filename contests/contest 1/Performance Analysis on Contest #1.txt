Performance Analysis
Contest #1
THINGS I DID GOOD
1. I was able to set up my environment properly and also configured my ide with the cph extension as hinted by our heads.
2. I was able to receive inputs of all forms from the test cases even though I had difficulties doing that in the mock contest. Fair to say I got used to the environment early enough.
3. I was able to solve majority of the problems. This is a good start for a first timer.
THINGS TO IMPROVE
1. I didn’t use my time properly. I got stuck in problems, and I wasted over an hour trying to understand the question and come up with a solution. 
* For the next contest, I will jump to other questions when I get stuck in a problem.
2. There were a lot of distractions from my phone during the contest. I had to turn the notifications off so that they wouldn't distract me.
* For the next contest, I will avoid any kind of distractions away from me so that during the contest, I will have my full attention.
3. I found it difficult implementing steps I have already encountered.
* I need to practice spaced revision regularly on questions I have already solved to help me keep up with things I learn.
